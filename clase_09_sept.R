# General idea: evaluate forecast accuracy:

# First example from the book
# Second, two series from BCCh

# Third, download a financial series using quantmod

# Review the measures and program by hand a hardcoded evaluation of
# Naive or season naive or trend naive against an auto.arima
# Introduce seasonal arima notation

# Then introduce the forecast package functions for accuracy


# Fourth, introduce time series cross validation
